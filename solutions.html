		<h2>PROJECT MAN AND EQUIPMENT HOURS TRACKING</h2>

		<p>
			Collates and then generate complete reports of the man-hours and equipment hours used to undertake project activities at
			WBS level.
		</p>
		<p>
			<span class="p-title">WBS definition - </span>Planners from Project Control Department will define together with the projects
			the WBS for each discipline and milestone as well as specify which activities will allow direct, indirect, management
			hours or any combination of them. These WBS will be entered and activated in pjtracker specifying range of dates (date
			from / to) where the activity can be used for man-hour reporting. WBS that will not spend man or equipment hours shall
			not be activated </p>
		<p>
			<span class="p-title">Teams definition - </span>Once all available activities have been activated PRJ/HOD will create
			the teams , assign the resources and the activities that can be reported by that team and assign the responsible for the
			daily online timesheet approval. Also there is need to activate for direct, indirect or management hours acceptance by
			job titles. Per instance, Project Manager can spend hours on Management activities and not on Direct or Indirect activities
			which will be used by workers
		</p>

		<p><span class="p-title">Data entry and approvals – </span>Authorised timekeepers will input the worked hours in a daily basis
			assigning the correct activity for each worker within the ones available for the team. Approvers will ensure correct number
			of hours and WBS assignment before final approval for the whole team
		</p>
		<p><span class="p-title">Reporting – </span>pjtracker will automatically send to PRJ and PCD daily, weekly and monthly summaries
			of man-hours spent per activity. Also there will be online reports accessible to authorized users that can be exported
			to different data formats (i.e.: excel) . pjtracker can also generate interfaces compatible with other standard ERP software
			to be uploaded
		</p>
		<p><span class="p-title">Alerts – </span>pjtracker sends an email every time an action is required by any of the actors. The
			first email is sent to the approver when the timesheet has been entered and request for approval has been clicked. pjtracker
			will also notify by email whenever a timesheet has not been filled or approved and is still pending after 24 hours until
			the actors take expected actions
		</p>
		<p><span class="p-title">Monitoring - </span>pjtracker tracks all activities inside the application like when the timekeeper
			introduced a record or made a modification, who approved it and when, who activated or inactivated a WBS, a team, when
			and to whom the reports or alerts have been sent, who and when extracted data from the database, etc. All this to ensure
			we know who is making use of the application and how
		</p>
		<p><span class="p-title">Primavera – </span>pjtracker can interact with Primavera. The project schedule can be exported to
			a file and then uploaded into pjtracker thus reducing error margin and loading time during the creation of activities.
			Once the man-hours are entered and approved in pjtracker the information can also be exported to a file and then imported
			to Primavera for progress updates
		</p>
		<p><span class="p-title">ERP – </span>pjtracker can also interact with the payroll modules of ERP systems like Oracle, PeopleSoft
			, SAP and Sage by receiving the active staff and at the end of the payroll period sending the total worked hours for payroll
			process all through interface files. If required pjtracker can also receive payroll figures and distribute it into activities
			that later on can be uploaded into the ERP system.
